# Re-designinig b-ber projects using `_settings` and `_overrides` Demo

This demo includes an example on how to control the design of a b-ber project using the [theme settings file](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Themes#using-_settingsscss), the [theme overrides file](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Themes#using-the-_overridesscss-file), as well as how to include [fonts](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Adding-Fonts) in the project directory or hosted remotely. It also shows how to control the design of the project for [specific builds](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Adding-Custom-Styles#customizing-styles-for-specific-builds). The `_settings.scss` and `overrides.scss` files found in the `_project/stylesheets/b-ber-theme-serif` folder have additional inline comments.
