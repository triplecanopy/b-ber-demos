::: chapter:full-bleed

The previous examples show how **figures inline** behave in different layouts. Following this paragraph is another way images can be included which makes them display as full bleed in the Reader. A "full bleed" treatment is only possible in the Reader, since in an EPUB (or Mobi/KF8) file, there is no way to make elements span multiple columns. In those formats, the image takes up the entirety of a single column or "page."
