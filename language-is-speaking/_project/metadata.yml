  value: >-
    The contents of this demo are an excerpt from the book The Amme Talks, a
    conversation between poet and machine. In 2003, poet Ulf Stolterfoht and a
    chatbot named Amme (which means wet nurse in German) met in Berlin. For one
    week, Stolterfoht interrogated Amme: not just a chatbot, actually, but a
    steel-and-glass construction with a computer interface, which is connected to
    a glass of milk, a robotic arm that tips over the glass, and a tube that
    releases water, as if urinating. The excerpt included here, Language is
    Speaking, is the introduction to the book by the translator of The Amme Talks,
    Shane Anderson. This demo includes the functionality and design of the figures
    directive.
