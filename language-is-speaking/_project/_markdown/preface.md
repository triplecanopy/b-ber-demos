# Preface

The contents of this demo are an excerpt from the book *[The Amme Talks](https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/the-amme-talks)*, a conversation between poet and machine, published by Triple Canopy. In 2003, poet Ulf Stolterfoht and a chatbot named Amme (which means “wet nurse” in German) met in Berlin. For one week, Stolterfoht interrogated Amme: not just a chatbot, actually, but a steel-and-glass construction with a computer interface, which is connected to a glass of milk, a robotic arm that tips over the glass, and a tube that releases water, as if urinating. The excerpt included here, "Language is Speaking," is the introduction to the book by the translator of *The Amme Talks*, Shane Anderson.

This demo includes the graphic design of a b-ber project using the [b-ber-theme-serif](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/serif); several of the basic [block directives](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/all-directives#block-directives); as well as the functionality and design of the [figures directive](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Figures-and-images).
