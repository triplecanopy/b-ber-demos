# Scoping Styles b-ber Demo

This demo includes several examples on how to [add custom styles](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Adding-Custom-Styles) to b-ber projects and "scope" them for different [output formats](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Output-formats). In addition, it includes an example on how to use [mixins](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/serif#mixins) and Sass variables from the [_settings.scss](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/blob/main/demos/basic/_project/_stylesheets/b-ber-theme-serif/_settings.scss) file from the [b-ber-theme-serif](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/serif).
